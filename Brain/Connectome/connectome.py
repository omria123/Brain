# The wrapt library implements easy to use wrapper objects, which delegates everything to the object you are
# using. It's very convenient to use (it can be used exactly in the same way).
# To change the reference of the ObjectProxy one should set the attribute __wrapped__
# Example:
#
# a = ObjectProxy(1)
# print(id(a)) #prints 12345 
# print(a) #prints 1
# a.__wrapped__ = 2
# print(id(a)) #prints 12345 
# print(a) #prints 2
# print(isinstance(a, int)) #prints True

class Connectome:
	"""
	Represent the graph of connections between areas and stimuli of the brain.
	This is a generic abstract class which offer a good infrastructure for building new models of connectome.
	You should implement some of the parts which are left for private case. For example when and how the connectome should
	be initialized, how the connections are represented.

	Attributes:
		areas: List of area objects in the connectome
		stimuli: List of stimulus objects in the connectome
		connections: Dictionary from tuples of BrainPart(Stimulus/Area) and Area to some object which
		represent the connection (e.g. numpy matrix). Each connection is held ObjectProxy which will make the connection.
		to be saved by reference. (This makes the get_subconnectome routine much easier to implement)
